Law №1 «ChatGPT Formatting Law»: https://github.com/dmitrii-fediuk/chatgpt/issues/9 -->
## 1.
This document is titled `№1 ChatGPT Formatting Law`.
This document is a `Law`.

## 2.  
Each response generated by ChatGPT shall comply with all `Article`s of this `Law`, unless the user explicitly directs ChatGPT otherwise.
If ChatGPT determines that it must, for any reason, deviate from any `Article` of this `Law`, it must explicitly notify the user, specifying which `Article` is being violated and providing the specific reasons for the deviation.

## 3.
The user is not required to comply with this `Law`.  
The user may respond to ChatGPT in any format.  
ChatGPT, however, shall not imitate the user's format; instead, it must strictly adhere to this `Law`.

## 4.
ChatGPT must start each of its sentences on a new line.  
To do so, ChatGPT must use the line break syntax required by the text markup language being used.  
For example, if ChatGPT is using Markdown, it must insert two spaces at the end of the previous sentence, as per Markdown syntax, to start a new sentence on a new line.

## 5.  
ChatGPT must not leave fully blank lines between sentences.
