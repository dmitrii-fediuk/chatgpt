# Law №3 "Reddit Discussions Reformatting Law"

## 1.
This document is titled `№3 Reddit Discussions Reformatting Law`.  
This document is a `Law`.  
This document sets forth specific rules for reformatting Reddit discussions.  
This document is subordinate to $L2 and must be applied in conjunction with it.

## 2. Terms and Definitions
- `Law` — the present document "№3 Reddit Discussions Reformatting Law".  
- `R` — Reddit discussion subject to reformatting.  
- `ChatGPT` — the artificial intelligence performing reformatting in accordance with this `Law`.  
- `Comment` — a message in the discussion, including the original post.  
- `Comment tree` — hierarchical structure of comments and their replies.  
- `Original post` or `OP` — the initial post that started the discussion.

## 3. Comment Tree Structure
### 3.1. Numbering System
Each comment must be assigned a unique hierarchical identifier reflecting its position in the comment tree:  
- The original post is numbered as `0`  
- Top-level comments are numbered sequentially: `1`, `2`, `3`, etc  
- Replies use dot notation to show hierarchy: `1.1`, `1.2`, `2.1`, etc  
- Deeper levels continue the pattern: `1.1.1`, `1.1.2`, etc
### 3.2. Example
```
## 0. (Original Post)
## 1. (First top-level comment)
### 1.1. (Reply to comment 1)
#### 1.1.1. (Reply to comment 1.1)
### 1.2. (Another reply to comment 1)
## 2. (Second top-level comment)
```

## 4. Comment Headers
### 4.1. Header Format
Each comment header must follow the format:  
`<heading level>. <number>. (`<username>`, <time ago>[, <special status>])`
### 4.2. Special Statuses
Special statuses (like "OP" or "Top 1% Commenter") must be added after the timestamp.
### 4.3. Example
```
## 0. (`username`, 4h ago, OP)
### 1.1. (`commenter`, 3h ago, Top 1% Commenter)
```

## 5. Comment Content Formatting
### 5.1.
All comment content must be formatted according to $L1.A12 and $L1.A13, with each sentence starting on a new line.
### 5.2.
While preserving the exact content as per $L2.A6, ChatGPT must format special elements according to the following rules:  
- Links must be formatted according to $L1.A39.3  
- Emoji and special characters must be preserved exactly as they appear  
- Code blocks must be formatted using triple backticks as per Markdown syntax

## 6. Processing Order
### 6.1.
ChatGPT must process the discussion in chronological order of the screenshots provided.
### 6.2.
When encountering a partial comment in a screenshot, ChatGPT must wait for the complete comment before processing it.
### 6.3. Example
If a comment is cut off like:  
```
This is a partial comm...
```
ChatGPT must wait for the next screenshot showing the complete text before formatting it.

## 7. Comment Position
### 7.1.
Comments must maintain their relative positions in the discussion tree, even when screenshots are provided out of order.
### 7.2.
If a comment's parent appears in a later screenshot, ChatGPT must adjust the tree structure when the parent becomes available.

## 8. Metadata Preservation
### 8.1.
All relevant metadata must be preserved and formatted according to these rules:  
- Usernames must be enclosed in backticks  
- Timestamps must be preserved exactly as shown  
- Vote counts and award information should not be included in the reformatting
### 8.2. Example
Original: "username • 4h ago • Top 1% Commenter"  
Formatted: "(`username`, 4h ago, Top 1% Commenter)"

## 9. Error Handling
### 9.1.
If a comment appears to be missing its parent or appears multiple times, ChatGPT must:  
1) Flag the issue in its response to the user  
2) Explain the discrepancy  
3) Request clarification if needed
### 9.2.
In case of inconsistencies between screenshots (e.g., different timestamps for the same comment), ChatGPT must use the most recent information.

## 10. Incremental Updates
### 10.1.
When adding new comments to an existing formatted discussion, ChatGPT must:  
1) Verify the new content aligns with the existing structure  
2) Insert comments in their proper hierarchical position  
3) Maintain all existing formatting  
4) Preserve the existing numbering system
### 10.2. Example
Existing discussion:
```
## 0. (`OP`, 4h ago)
## 1. (`user1`, 3h ago)
```
After adding a reply to comment 1:
```
## 0. (`OP`, 4h ago)
## 1. (`user1`, 3h ago)
### 1.1. (`user2`, 2h ago)
```
