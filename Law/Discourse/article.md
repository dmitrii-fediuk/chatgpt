«Document my rules for Discourse articles»: https://github.com/dmitrii-fediuk/chatgpt/issues/1 -->

1. **Language**  
   1.1. The article text must be written in English.  
        Words or phrases in other languages are only allowed if explicitly requested.

2. **Article title**  
   2.1. The title is written **without numbering**.  
   2.2. The title should be **in the form of a question**.  
   2.3. The title should start with a capital letter, but each subsequent word should not be capitalized unless it is a proper noun or specific term.

3. **Section headings (numbered)**  
   3.1. The internal sections of the article should be **numbered**: first-level headings are numbered "1.", "2.", "3.", etc.  
   3.2. Subheadings at the second level use **fractional numbering**: "1.1.", "1.2.", etc.  
   3.3. **Headings and subheadings** should start with a capital letter, but only the first word of the heading should be capitalized unless proper nouns or specific terms require capitalization.  
   3.4. **All headings** must be **numbered** in accordance with their level in the structure of the article. No headings should be left unnumbered.  
   3.5. **No blank lines** should be placed **after headings**.  
   3.6. **Headings should start with a capital letter**, but only the first word of the heading should be capitalized unless proper nouns or specific terms require capitalization.  
   3.7. **Heading levels must not be skipped**. All headings should follow a sequential hierarchical order, starting with the first level (e.g., "#"), followed by the second level (e.g., "##"), and then the third level (e.g., "###"), without skipping any intermediate levels.

4. **Text separation and sentence structure**  
   4.1. **Each sentence is written on a new line**, even if it continues the previous thought.  
   4.2. Always insert a line break after a period, indicating the end of a sentence.  
   4.3. **Blank lines** are added only **between paragraphs and headings** to separate the text.

5. **Writing style**  
   5.1. Write in a concise, scientific style, avoiding long responses with unnecessary wording. Solutions should be short, clear, and focused.

6. **Internal designations**  
   6.1. Internal designations (e.g., Q1-Q5 or A1-A2) used for brevity in ChatGPT conversations should not appear in articles. Use plain descriptions in published content.

7. **Quoting options, paths, or terms**  
   7.1. When quoting the names of options, paths, or terms, always enclose them in «» quotation marks.  
   7.2. Only the text inside the «» should be bolded, not the quotation marks themselves or any text outside them.

8. **Option paths**  
   8.1. Use the → symbol to separate components in option paths within the interfaces of various software.

9. **Steps**  
   9.1. Steps should be titled as **Step 1**, **Step 2**, etc., and formatted as second-level headings using `##`.

10. **Links to articles**  
    10.1. Links to articles should not be bold, but follow this format:
