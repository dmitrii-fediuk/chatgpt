   2.3. The title is written **in lowercase letters** (not all capitalized).

3. **Section headings (numbered)**  
   3.1. The internal sections of the article should be **numbered**: first-level headings are numbered "1.", "2.", "3.", etc.

   3.3. Headings and subheadings are written **in lowercase letters**.
