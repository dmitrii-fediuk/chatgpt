«Document my rules for Discourse articles»: https://github.com/dmitrii-fediuk/chatgpt/issues/1 -->

1. **Article title**  
   1.1. The title is written **without numbering**.  
   1.2. The title should be **in the form of a question**.  
   1.3. The title is written **in lowercase letters** (not all capitalized).

2. **Section headings (numbered)**  
   2.1. The internal sections of the article should be **numbered**: first-level headings are numbered "1.", "2.", "3.", etc.  
   2.2. Subheadings at the second level use **fractional numbering**: "1.1.", "1.2.", etc.  
   2.3. Headings and subheadings are written **in lowercase letters**.

3. **Text separation**  
   3.1. **Each sentence is written on a new line**, even if it continues the previous thought.  
   3.2. **Blank lines** are added only **between paragraphs and headings** to separate the text.
