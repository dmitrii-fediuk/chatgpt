### 1. Analyzing the content of images  
1.1. After the images are uploaded, you inform me that they are related to a specific topic.  
1.2. I analyze the images for discussions or data related to the main topic.  

### 2. Creating a list of topics  
2.1. Based on the images, I extract all the discussion titles or topics.  
2.2. For each image, I create a list item with a brief description of the topic it addresses.  

### 3. Formatting the list  
3.1. I format the list as a numbered or bullet point list in Markdown format.  

### 4. Adding links to original pages  
4.1. For each title, I add a link to the original discussion page using information from the image (if the URL is available).  
4.2. I modify the format of the link, keeping only the numerical part of the URL to shorten the link.  

### 5. Modifying the format of the links  
5.1. I move the link to appear before the topic description.  
5.2. I position the anchor (the numerical part of the link) before the topic title.  

### 6. Reordering the list  
6.1. I reorder the topics in ascending order based on the number in the link.  

### 7. Final formatting  
7.1. I replace the dash (" — ") with a colon (": ") between the link and the topic description to maintain a consistent formatting style.
